# weather-app-express

### Get the current weather of any given place

The goal of this exercise was to call an API (https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding) and use the retrieved data to call 
a weather forecast API (https://api.darksky.net/forecast) to run our application. In addition, an UI based on EJS template 
was added. 

Just clone the project and run
`npm install`
and
`npm start`
in your console. If you want to use this project, you should obtain your own keys to access the APIs and substitute `[your-key]` field in the requested URL.
